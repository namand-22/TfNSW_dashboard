This is a simple Kindle dashboard project that takes train/metro departure information from the TfNSW API and extracts key information such as the estimated time of departure, train line and the final destination. After getting this information, the program formats it nicely into a web page that updates the time till departure when refreshed.


How to run:
1. git clone...
2. change into TfNSW_dashboard directory
3. run with terminal command `python app.py`
